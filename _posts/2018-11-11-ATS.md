## Aim of the Project

The aim of this project is to develop and end-to-end model which can perform automatic text scoring on essays and to create an user interface which enhances the usage of the model developed.

## Intro

Automated Text Scoring (ATS) systems are targeted at both alleviating the workload of the teachers and improving the feedback cycle in educational systems. Traditionally, the task of ATS has been regarded as a machine learning problem which learns to approximate the marking process with supervised learning. This mainly involves trying to extract some handcrafted and standard features of the essays and then passed into a machine learning based classifier. These features were mostly some basic features like essay length, sentence length, grammar correctness, readability etc.
