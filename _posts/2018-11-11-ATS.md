## Aim of the Project

The aim of this project is to develop and end-to-end model which can perform automatic text scoring on essays and to create an user interface which enhances the usage of the model developed.

## Intro

Automated Text Scoring (ATS) systems are targeted at both alleviating the workload of the teachers and improving the feedback cycle in educational systems. Traditionally, the task of ATS has been regarded as a machine learning problem which learns to approximate the marking process with supervised learning. This mainly involves trying to extract some handcrafted and standard features of the essays and then passed into a machine learning based classifier. These features were mostly some basic features like essay length, sentence length, grammar correctness, readability etc.

Deep learning based ATS systems demonstrated that neural network architectures such as LSTM and CNN are capable of outperforming systems that extensively required handcrafted features. However, these models do not consider Logical Flow and coherence over time. 

In the proposed architecture, **SKIPFLOW LSTM** adopts parameterized tensor compositions to model the relationships between different points within an essay.

This in turn generates neural coherence features that can support predictions. As said above, it mainly models coherence and semantic relatedness over time. This is done in the following way :

- It reads the essay and models semantic relationships between two points of an essay using Neural Tensor Layer.
- It generates Neural Coherence Features by performing semantic matching k-times while reading. 
- It models the relationship between distant states with additional parameters which enhances memorization and improves performance of the deep architecture by allowing access to intermediate states. This eases the burden and provides protection against vanishing gradient by exposing hidden states to deeper layers. 
- Most importantly, it performs semantic matching and semantic modeling.
